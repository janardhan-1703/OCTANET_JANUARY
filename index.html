        A cuisine is a specific set of cooking traditions and practices, often<br> associated with a specific culture or region. 
        Each cuisine involves food preparation in a particular style,<br> of food and drink of particular types,
         to produce individually consumed items or distinct meals.<br> A cuisine is frequently named after the region or place
          where it originated. A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. 
          Religious food laws can also exercise a strong influence on such culinary practices.<br>

Let us know about the different food cultures around the world <br>
Food refers to nutritious substances that when eaten sustain life and health. Dietary habits therefore play a
key role in supporting life and well-being. Culture, on the other hand, refers to beliefs, attitudes, and practices
accepted by the members of a particular group or society. Culture characterizes people in terms of language,
customs, values, norms, rules, technologies, products, organizations, and institutions. Culture has also been
described as a social identity associated with shared behaviour, a pattern that includes food habits, dress,
language, family structure, and sometimes religious affiliation.<br>
